# general

- find a nice acronym for round


# implementation

- push [T] inside the round
- timeout for the predicate layer
- split into multiple parts
  so we can use macros for the testing and debugging in the main project
  cleaner separation between the runtime and the declarations
- interfacte for predicate layer and more predicates 
- Process.exit

# verification

- rewrite the round to generate VCs
- add temporal elements to formula/boolean 
- decision procedure


# network emulation: packet loss, delay, ...
