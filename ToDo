# general

- find a nice acronym for round
- interface between the algorithm and the predicate
- expected number of messages for a round: inferred from the send function
- locally testable safety/liveness conditions: of the form ∀ p. QF-φ(p)


# implementation

- push [T] inside the round
- round should share the same allocator
- timeout for the predicate layer
- split into multiple parts
  so we can use macros for the testing and debugging in the main project
  cleaner separation between the runtime and the declarations
- interfacte for predicate layer and more predicates 
- Process.exit
- ghost variables: remove at compile time


# verification

- generate a transition relation for the round
- add temporal elements to formula/boolean 
- decision procedure


# network emulation: packet loss, delay, ...
